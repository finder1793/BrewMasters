## Common Mistakes

```

```

‚úÖ **Correct effect name**
```yaml
type: SPEED  # Correct - all caps
```

‚ùå **Duration in seconds**
```yaml
duration: 60  # This is only 3 seconds!
```

‚úÖ **Duration in ticks**
```yaml
duration: 1200  # This is 60 seconds (1200 ticks √∑ 20 = 60 seconds)
```

## Understanding Durations

Duration is measured in **ticks**. There are **20 ticks per second**.

| Seconds | Ticks | Common Use |
|---------|-------|------------|
| 10s | 200 | Very short buff |
| 30s | 600 | Short buff |
| 1min | 1200 | Standard buff |
| 2min | 2400 | Long buff |
| 3min | 3600 | Extended buff |
| 5min | 6000 | Very long buff |
| 8min | 9600 | Maximum vanilla duration |

## Understanding Amplifiers

Amplifier determines the **level** of the effect:

| Amplifier | Level | Display |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| 0 | 1 | Effect I |
| 1 | 2 | Effect II |
| 2 | 3 | Effect III |
| 3 | 4 | Effect IV |

Example:
```yaml
- type: STRENGTH
  duration: 1200
  amplifier: 1  # This gives Strength II for 60 seconds
```
